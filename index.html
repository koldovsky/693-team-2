                    handled. As tobacco is a natural product, its quality and flavor can differ from one year to
                    another. The country and the region also matter. The tobacco produced in Cuba is known for its

                HOW TO CHOOSE A CIGAR?
            </h3>
            <p class="faqaccordion_answer">Wider cigars are generally a mellower smoke. A narrow cigar has a slightly
                higher
                burn temperature and its flavor is dominated by the wrapper, which results in a stronger-tasting smoke.
                The
                length of a cigar also affects your experience.

                WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT CUBAN CIGARS?
            </h3>
            <p class="faqaccordion_answer">Tobacco has been grown in Cuba for hundreds of years, and manufacturers have
                been
                making cigars in this country since the time of Phillip II of Spain. In Cuba, there is the perfect
                combination of climate, tobacco leaf quality and the availability of modern technologies.
